MaxCare extended service plans are optional plans you can purchase to cover your car's major systems and parts for additional miles, with flexible monthly budgets.

        "answer": "A safety recall occurs when a manufacturer or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) finds that a condition or defect that could affect the safety or operation of a vehicle may exist in a specific vehicle or series of vehicles. The manufacturer notifies authorized dealers, repair facilities, and registered vehicle owners so that they can have the vehicle diagnosed and repaired. For more about the U.S. vehicle safety recall process, visit https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls.",

Customers are urged to have any unrepaired safety recalls fixed by the manufacturer after purchase.",

        "answer": "Manufacturers send recall notices based on state vehicle registration data. To ensure you receive notices, keep your registration information current. CarMax recommends registering your car with the manufacturer after purchase by providing your address, purchase date, VIN, and vehicle details. This helps you receive recall notifications directly from the manufacturer. Most manufacturers also have VIN-specific recall lookup tools. Additionally, you can subscribe for email safety recall notifications for up to five vehicles at https://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/subscriptions/index.cfm. You can always use the NHTSA VIN-specific Recall Look-Up at https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls.",
