        "question": "What is the difference between the CarMax limited warranty and the optional MaxCare® extended service plan?",
        "answer": "Every car we sell automatically comes with a CarMax limited warranty, even if it's still covered under the manufacturer's warranty. This includes coverage of major systems plus hundreds of parts inside and out, including labor, for 90 days or 4,000 miles (whichever comes first). MaxCare extended service plans are optional plans you can purchase to cover your car's major systems and parts for additional miles, with flexible monthly budgets.
